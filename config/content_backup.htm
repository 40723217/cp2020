<h6>電腦硬件是一門線上課程，其中的內容將以線上文本和活動的形式呈現<br/>PC Hardware is an online course, where the content will be presented in the form of both text and activities.</h6>
<p>與傳統課程比較會有更高度的靈活性，但學生必須有更高的自主性去承擔學習的責任<br/>While you will have more flexibility than in a traditional course, you will also have more responsibility for your own learning.</p>
<p>為了這些，你將需要:</p>
<p>計劃如何瀏覽每個單元<br/>確定如何使用課程的各種功能來幫助您學習<br/>確定何時需要尋求其他支持<br/>您需要了解課程內容，這些都有志助於學習<br/>Plan how to work through each unit.<br/>Determine how to use the various features of the course to help you learn.<br/>Decide when you need to seek additional support.<br/>What You Need to Know About the Course</p>
<p>這些單元將會帶領並支持你成為獨立製作者，這會包刮:<br/>This course contains multiple modules. Each module has features designed to support you as an independent learner, including</p>
<p>學習目標：這些是本節末尾應該做的事情的描述。學習目標將使您能夠指導學習努力，並在探索內容和參與活動時監控進度。<br/>Learning Objectives: These are descriptions of what you should be able to do at the end of a section. A Learning Objective will allow you to direct your learning efforts and enable you to monitor your progress as you explore the content and engage in the activities.</p>
<p><span>解釋性內容：這是每章的信息性“內容”。由簡短的段落，信息，示例，圖像和說明組成，此說明性內容包含以下內容：<br/></span><span>Explanatory Content: This is the informational “meat” of every chapter. Consisting of short passages of text with information, examples, images, and explanations, this explanatory content contains pieces such as:</span></p>
<p><span>演練：這些是嵌入在頁面中的視頻，以例證您正在探索的概念。他們可能會提供有關主題的更詳細說明，或指導您完成流程的各個步驟。<br/></span><span>Walk-throughs: These are videos embedded in the pages to exemplify the concepts you are exploring. They may provide a more detailed explanation of a topic or guide you through the steps of a process.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>示例：旨在說明該課程支持您實現的技能和學習目標的特定應用。<br/></span><span>Examples: Designed to illustrate specific applications of the skills and learning objectives that the course supports you to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span>實驗室：模擬和實驗室活動旨在為您提供與各種硬件元素進行交互的機會。<br/></span><span>Labs: Simulations and lab activities designed to give you an opportunity to interact with various hardware elements.</span></p>
<p><span>不少學生都會注意到側邊欄，這些側邊欄有兩個目的：（1）快速回顧概念，例如PC硬件材料中使用的“高度專業化的輸入設備”，以及（2）提供其他材料或背景信息您可能會發現令人驚訝和有趣的東西(但是不會進到測驗當中)<br/>Many Students Wonder sidebars: These sidebars serve two purposes: (1) to give a quick review of concepts, such as "highly specialized input devices," that are used in the PC Hardware material and (2) to provide additional material or background information that you may find surprising and interesting but that is not going to be assessed in the Quiz.</span></p>
<p><span>學習活動：在整個課程中散佈著不同類型的活動。它們包括:<br/>Learning Activities: There are different types of activities interspersed throughout the course. They include:<br/></span></p>
<p><span>實踐中學習：實踐中學習的實踐遵循簡短的說明和示例。這些活動使您有機會研究和實踐關鍵思想。實踐中學習有提示和反饋，以在需要時指導您。<br/>Learn By Doing activities: Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>"我了解了嗎？"：我了解了嗎？是您進行快速“自我審視”的機會。這些活動沒有提示，通常會跟隨“做中學”活動，以便您確定自己是否了解關鍵思想。這將幫助您確保已準備好進行分級活動<br/>Learn By Doing activities: Learn By Doing activities follow the short explanations and examples. These activities give you the chance to investigate and practice key ideas. Learn By Doing activities have hints and feedback to guide you if you need it.<br/><span></span></span></p>
<p><span>測驗：這些是評分的短期作業。每個模塊的末尾都有一個測驗。測驗將向您和您的老師展示您對關鍵概念的理解程度。如果您閱讀了該信息並在每個模塊中進行了活動，那麼您應該已經做好測驗的準備。<br/>Quizzes: These are short assignments that are graded. There is a Quiz at the end of each Module. The Quiz will show you and your instructor how well you understand the key concepts. If you read the information and do the activities in each Module, you should be ready for the Quiz.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>神經回饋認知：這些活動旨在支持您作為獨立學習者的發展，鼓勵您反思自己的進步併計劃繼續取得成功。這些活動包括：<br/>Metacognitive Activities: These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:<br/></span></p>
<p><span>我的回應：這些簡短的活動位於模塊的末尾；他們鼓勵您反思本單元的學習進度，並估計您認為自己達到本單元學習目標的程度。這些活動還提供了一個分享繼續存在的問題和困難領域的地方（如果您與講師一起使用本課程，您的問題將與講師分享）。<br/>My Response activities: These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you've attained the module's learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you're using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor).<br/></span></p>
<p><span>檢查點：這些活動位於課程的各個部分之後，這些部分可能特別具有挑戰性或需要其他練習。這些元認知檢查點可以鼓勵您回顧迄今為止的進展並進行自我評估：您準備好繼續嗎，還是您認為您需要其他材料，練習或自我評估？如果您感覺還沒有準備好繼續，可以使用這些檢查點來鏈接到其他學習資料。<br/>Checkpoints: These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive checkpoints encourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you're not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials.<br/></span></p>
